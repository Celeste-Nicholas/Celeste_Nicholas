# Projects

## [Representations for Teachers as Learners (RepTaL)](http://reptalproject.org/) 
### PI: [Joshua Danish](http://www.joshuadanish.com/) 
The RepTaL project supports rural elementary teachers in incorporating representations (e.g., diagrams, graphs) into their science teaching. The learning sciences and science education research on *modeling practices* guide the investigation.

Additionally, Celeste is pursuing questions around equity relating to the rural, predominantly white, study population. Viewing rural communities exclusively through lens of white privilege can obscure ways in which they are vulnerable (e.g., geographic isolation, small student populations, underfunding, and difficulty attracting highly-qualified teachers of science). 
  
Celeste wants to understand how teachers draw upon rural student funds of knowledge when teaching with representations. This analysis informs the project's iterative professional development designs – as the team encourages teachers to consider student funds when planning and when reflecting on artifacts of practice (e.g., student work, lesson video).

## [Workplace Simulation Projects (WSPs)](https://p16.education.indiana.edu/projects/current/workplace-simulation-projects/defense.html)
### PI: [Dionne Cross Francis](https://education.indiana.edu/about/directory/profiles/cross_francis-dionne.html)
Celeste has directed multiple WSPs, which leverage volunteers from local STEM industries to engage high school students in authentic STEM learning. WSPs provide collaborative, student-driven, and interdisciplinary learning experiences aligned with real-world industry problems. 

For instance, Celeste obtained funding for and directed a residential academy for underrepresented high school students organized around a design challenge faced by **[Baxter Biopharma Solutions](https://p16.education.indiana.edu/projects/current/balfour/academy/workplace-sim/index.html)** - how to safely and cost effectively manufacture, transport, and administer freeze-dried vaccines in the developing world. 

Driven by the potential of these kinds of learning environments to broaden participation in STEM and address global challenges, Celeste is studying authenticity from the perspectives of multiple project stake holders (e.g., students, teachers, STEM volunteers). Her analyses focuses on how authentic elements of the learning environment, specifically involvement of STEM professional volunteers, supported student engagement.

## Experiences of Former Participants in Teen Advocates for Sexual Health [(TASH)](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-st-louis-region-southwest-missouri/education/teen-advocates-sexual-health)
Celeste seeks to understand how STEM education can empower youth to contribute to social change around public health disparities. She views Freirian critical consciousness as foundational to both individual and community empowerment. 

To explore the link between health knowledge, critical consciousness, and action, Celeste conducted phenomenologically-based interviews with staff and former participants in Planned Parenthood youth organizing group, Teen Advocates for Sexual Health (TASH). Participating teens received critically-oriented comprehensive sexual education and advocated for less restrictive school-based sexual education policies. 

Findings integrate psychologial empowerment and sociopolitical development lenses to relate elements of TASH’s reproductive justice programming to adult empowerment outcomes. Insights include: (1) political efficacy, critical consciousness, and TASH-related social capital supported alumni in pursuing socially-oriented careers – building capacity beyond involvement in TASH; (2) social justice pedagogies practiced by adult leaders fostered safe, but uncomfortable dialogues productive for critical consciousness development.   

## [Science Literacy Though Science Journalism (SciJourn)](http://www.scijourner.org/)
### PI: [Wendy Saul](https://coe.umsl.edu/mycoe/p2_profiles/viewProfile/sso_id/saulw)
The SciJourn project supported students in writing and publishing science news articles on topics of their choice while engaging in the authentic practices of professional science journalists. Celeste participated in SciJourn as a teacher consultant and later as a member of the research team. 

She examined the ways SciJourn, as a science journalism community of practice, fostered positive writer identities. Teen participants described more positive writer identities in SciJourn compared to typical school writing experieneces.
