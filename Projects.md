# Projects

## [Representations for Teachers as Learners (RepTaL)](http://reptalproject.org/) 
### PI: [Joshua Danish](http://www.joshuadanish.com/) 
The RepTaL project supports rural elementary teachers in incorporating representations (e.g., diagrams, graphs) into their science teaching. The learning sciences and science education research on modeling guide the investigation. Additionally, Celeste is pursuing questions around equity relating to the rural, predominantly white, study population. Viewing rural communities exclusively through lens of white privilege can obscure ways in which they are vulnerable (e.g., geographic isolation, small student populations, underfunding, and difficulty attracting highly-qualified teachers of science). Celeste wants to understand how teachers draw upon rural student funds of knowledge when teaching with representations. This analysis informs the project's iterative professional development designs â€“ as the team encourages teachers to consider student funds when planning and when reflecting on artifacts of practice (e.g., student work, lesson video).

## [Workplace Simulation Projects (WSPs)](https://p16.education.indiana.edu/projects/current/workplace-simulation-projects/defense.html)
### PI: [Dionne Cross Francis](https://education.indiana.edu/about/directory/profiles/cross_francis-dionne.html)
Celeste has directed multiple WSPs, which leverage volunteers from local STEM industries to support high school students in authentic STEM learning. WSPs provide collaborative, student-driven, and interdisciplinary learning experiences aligned with real-world industry problems. For instance, Celeste obtained funding for and directed a week-long residential academy for underrepresented high school students organized around a design challenge faced by STEM professionals at [Baxter Biopharma Solutions](https://p16.education.indiana.edu/projects/current/balfour/academy/workplace-sim/index.html) - how to safely and cost effectively to manufacture, transport, and administer vaccines in the developing world. Driven by the potential of these kinds of learning environments to broaden participation in STEM and address global challenges, Celeste is studying authenticity from the perspectives of multiple project stake holders (students, teachers, STEM volunteers). Analyses focus on how elements of the learning environment designed to be authentic supported student engagement (e.g., autonomy, collaboration, involvement of volunteers). Findings inform the design of authentic learning environments involving STEM professional volunteers.

## [Science Literacy Though Science Journalism (SciJourn)](http://www.scijourner.org/)
