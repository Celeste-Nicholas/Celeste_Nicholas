# Projects

## [Representations for Teachers as Learners (RepTaL)](http://reptalproject.org/) 
### PI: [Joshua Danish](http://www.joshuadanish.com/) 
The RepTaL project supports rural elementary teachers in incorporating representations (e.g., diagrams, graphs) into their science teaching. The learning sciences and science education research on modeling guide the investigation. Additionally, Celeste is pursuing questions around equity relating to the rural, predominantly white, study population. Viewing rural communities exclusively through lens of white privilege can obscure ways in which they are vulnerable (e.g., geographic isolation, small student populations, underfunding, and difficulty attracting highly-qualified teachers of science). Celeste wants to understand how teachers draw upon rural student funds of knowledge when teaching with representations. This analysis informs the project's iterative professional development designs â€“ as the team encourages teachers to consider student funds when planning and when reflecting on artifacts of practice (e.g., student work, lesson video).

## [Workplace Simulation Projects (WSPs)](https://p16.education.indiana.edu/projects/current/workplace-simulation-projects/defense.html)
### PI: [Dionne Cross Francis](https://education.indiana.edu/about/directory/profiles/cross_francis-dionne.html)
Celeste has directed multiple projects in rural Indiana high schools created and facilitated in partnership with volunteers from local STEM industries (e.g., defense, biopharma). We prioritized authenticity in our designs aiming to more student-driven, interdisciplinary, and collaborative than traditional schooling experiences. More meaningful, collaborative STEM learning experiences may appeal more to students underrepresented in STEM fields, who face multiple barriers to accessing STEM pathways. Driven by the potential of authentic learning environments to enhance access for underrepresented students, I am studying authenticity from the perspectives of multiple stake holders (engineering and math students, teachers, engineer volunteers). My analysis focuses on how elements of the learning environment designed to be authentic supported student engagement (e.g., autonomy, collaboration, involvement of engineers). Findings inform the design of authentic learning environments involving STEM professional volunteers.
