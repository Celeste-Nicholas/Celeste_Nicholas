## Celeste Nicholas, Ph.D.

I am committed to addressing the question, "How can science and STEM education contribute to a just society?‚Äù I bring a multidisciplinary lens to understanding and challenging inequity in science learning environments, drawing upon sociocultural, critical and psychological perspectives. My research agenda has three major foci: (1) how teacher knowledge and practice support equitable science and STEM learning, (2) the ways in which community partnerships can enhance access to authentic science and STEM education; and (3) the design of learning environments to foster critical knowledge and action around science and STEM-related social justice issues.
